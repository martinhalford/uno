## Game Rules

1. Players must play a card that matches either:

   - The color of the top card
   - The number of the top card
   - A Wild or Wild Draw Four card (which can be played on any card)

2. When playing a Wild or Wild Draw Four card, the player must specify the next color.

3. Action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two) can only be played on matching colors.

4. When a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four is played, the next player must draw the specified number of cards.

5. The game continues until one player has no cards left.

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:

- 200: Success
- 201: Game created
- 204: Game deleted
- 400: Bad request (invalid move, missing color for Wild card)
- 404: Game not found

## Development

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run in CLI mode (instead of API server):

```bash
cargo run
```
